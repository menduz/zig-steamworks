// - usLegacySteamPort is the local port used to communicate with the steam servers.
//   NOTE: unless you are using ver old Steam client binaries, this parameter is ignored, and
//         you should pass 0.  Gameservers now always use WebSockets to talk to Steam.
//         This protocol is TCP-based and thus always uses an ephemeral local port.
//         Older steam client binaries used UDP to talk to Steam, and this argument was useful.
//         A future version of the SDK will remove this argument.
// - usGamePort is the port that clients will connect to for gameplay.
// - usQueryPort is the port that will manage server browser related duties and info
//		pings from clients.  If you pass MASTERSERVERUPDATERPORT_USEGAMESOCKETSHARE for usQueryPort, then it
//		will use "GameSocketShare" mode, which means that the game is responsible for sending and receiving
//		UDP packets for the master  server updater. See references to GameSocketShare in isteamgameserver.h.
// - The version string is usually in the form x.x.x.x, and is used by the master server to detect when the
//		server is out of date.  (Only servers with the latest version will be listed.)
